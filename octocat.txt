Git Notes

1) cd directory/path
Navigate to project folder where you will build project

2) git init
This starts a git repo in the current directory specified in our path

3) git status
Checks the status of a repository at any given time. If there are untracked files in the folder, git will tell you so when you run the status

4) git add <filename with extension [file.ext]> or git add '*.txt'
This tells Git to start tracking changes to that file. The wildcard is used to add all txt files

(if we run git status, after we have made unsaved changes to the file, it will inform us of changes that we need to commit). This is known as the STAGING AREA - which means they are not in our repo yet. A commit in git is performed in two steps: staging and actual commit. As long as changes are still in the staging area, we can still edit them, etc.)

5) git commit -m "Note"
Commits changes with a note used to explain changes. Dont have to specify file path in a commit, we have already done that in staging

6) git log
Allows us to search a few commits
